# TODO
- Replace "locker" with a utility slot that only allows medikits as an example of a usable item.
- let's add a note to the vehicle-related TODOs/future plans that vehicles could have PILOTS instead of being autonomous things.

# Terror Defense Future Notes

These are notes for the future Terror Defense mod.  *Ignore them for now, they are just notes for me.*

## Armor Damage Config

Based on Xus's original armor damage code.

```yaml
- armor damage config for XcomTD
    damageAlter:
      ToArmor: 0.2                 # legacy: power * 0.2  (clean-penetration wear)
      ToArmorBlocked: 0.05         # legacy: (originalPower - armor*0.5) * 0.05 + 1
      ToArmorBlockedThreshold: 0.5
      ToArmorOverPen: 1.0          # legacy: (power - armor) on a smash-through
      ToArmorOverPenThreshold: 2.0
```
